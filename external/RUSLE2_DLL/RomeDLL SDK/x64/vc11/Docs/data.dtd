<!--
  External DTD for validating XML archives that are created by Rusle2.
  By default this is not included in the archive but can be manually using
    <!DOCTYPE Obj SYSTEM "absolute or relative path to DTD file">

  Files which are stored externally (outside the database) will have the
following doctype declaration inserted, to prevent browsers from being
confused by custom entities used to encode some strings.
  Note that == has been used to represent XML comment symbols.
  <!DOCTYPE Obj
  [
    <!ENTITY und '&#x5F;'><!== '_' ==>
    <!ENTITY per '&#x25;'><!== '%' ==>
  ] >

  Rusle2 is not sensitive to the order of elements. We load the entire XML file
first and use a DOM interface to access the XML data.
  All files have the same format, independent of the object type of the file.
e.g. A climate file stored in "climates" uses the same format as a file stored
in "managements". Only the contents will change.
  The allowable names for parameters, and their default values are specified in
the "catalog" description, which is stored as another XML file.

<!-- The following elements are saved for all parameters.
  Name - The internal name used by Rusle2. (e.g. "SAND").
  Dims - The dimensions of this parameter (up to 2).
         These can either be named parameters, or decimal integers.
		 If there is more than one they will be separated by a comma.
		 If this element isn't present the default is "1".
  Fn   - The calc function for this parameter.
  Data - The data for this parameter.
         This can be stored for some parameters which have a calc function.
  Calc - Purely calculated data.
         This element is only stored when saving files for regression tests.
  Unit - The unit associated with the data. This is an internal Rusle2 name.
         (e.g. "U_KG_P_YR" == "kg/year")
  Var  - Data "variant". We use 2 types:
         "interval"   (default) data is stored as interval values.
		 "cumulative" data is stored as a sum of all values from the 0th.

  The elements <ConcurFn> and <NoResizeTrigger> were saved in the past,
but are no longer used, and are discarded on loading.

<!-- All data is stored inside "objects".
  A "file" object is the basic unit of information we store.
  Objects can also nest recursively.
  <Obj> is used for file objects. It is the only element that can't be stored
        inside another object. In general <Sub> and parameter elements can be
		stored inside eachother.
  <Sub> is used for sub-objects, which are stored inside other objects.
  All Rusle2 parameters are stored inside either a <Sub> or <Obj> object.
  The <Type> element is stored in <Obj> elements to allow reading them back in
from disk without having to guess what object type they represent.

<!-- Parameters stored by Rusle2
  Parameters are classified by the type of data they store.
  Note that all parameters can store the data value "NaN" in their <Data> element.
This represents a value that is missing. It is not an IEEE NaN value, and can
be used for most parameter types. Parameters which store string data will
generally use an empty string instead of the string "NaN".
  <Flt> parameters are used to store both floating point and integer data.
These form the bulk of all Rusle2 parameters.
  <Rmt> parameters are "proxies" for other parameters. They store the name of
another file to get the actual values from.
  <Ovr> parameters are a type of remote parameter, that can  store their own
data, which overrides that of the actual parameter which they are a remote of.
  Parameters are now serialized in alphabetical order in each object to make 
diffs easier. This is done without regard to parameter type.

<!-- The data stored for this parameter.
  The <Data> element's text will be a string of values separated by whitespace.
  If the values can contain spaces, they are single-quoted, and any single quotes
in the value strings are replaced with "&apos;".
  These substrings are XML-encoded to escape any single quotes they might contain,
since that would prevent us from being able to parse the string into substrings.
  In the past we used "&apos;" (note difference) which is automatically expanded by
XML parsers, which breaks our ability to distinguish between an apostrophe embedded
in a string, and a string delimiter. These must be fixed on loading in.
