** Titles file used to control what unit tests run.
** See documentation of function UnitTestCanRun() in the source code.
** This configuration file is for use by developers only.
** It is not needed during the normal use of the Rusle2 application and DLL.
** This file can be omitted from a normal Rusle2 application or DLL installation.

** Add titles for test objects and parameters to suppress warnings.
** These are created by the unit test code only, so lack normal title strings.

** If key "UnitTests:CanRun" has a 0 value, no tests will run.
** A default value of 1 is hard-coded into the source.
** Uncomment this line to turn off all unit testing.
*UnitTests:CanRun	0

** The value "UnitTests:Default" provides a default probability for a
**   test to run if no value is explicitly declared for it.
** It should be a floating-point value in the range [0, 1] inclusive.
** This can be used to decrease the startup overhead of unit tests if it becomes too costly,
**   without turning them off entirely, or turning off a fixed set.
*UnitTests:Default	0.1

** Run some specific unit tests with fixed probabilities.
** This overrides the default probability "UnitTests:Default" above.
** These do not have an effect if "UnitTests:CanRun" turns off unit tests entirely.

** Turn off tests which are currently broken.
** Because titles are loaded in order, from the top of the file,
**   this will override any probabilities set above.

** Turn off tests which change access levels.
** Changing access levels during unit tests can permanently destroy some menu items.
** This is due to a bug in our menu recreation code, which is not yet fixed.

** Turn off use of BadFileMap code.

** Change the location of the Session directory from a Win32 Temp directory
**   to a relative directory under the Rusle2 root directory.
*DirPaths:Session	Session

** Turn on additional logging of engine behavior.
** This is more verbose than is usually required, and tends to flood the "commands.xml" log file.
** If this is turned on you may want to increase the size limit "App.LogFiles.MaxSize.LOG_HIST" below.
*App.Engine.Logging	1

** Set the default size for log files.
** If this is <= 0, no loggging will be done unless a size is explicitly set for that file.
** These settings will not affect things until titles have been loaded.
*App.LogFiles.MaxSize.DEFAULT	100000

** Set the maximum log file size for individual log files
** The LOG_HIST file needs to be significantly larger than the other files
**   unless log file filtering is being done.
