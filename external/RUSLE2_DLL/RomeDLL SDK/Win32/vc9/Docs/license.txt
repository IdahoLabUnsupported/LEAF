Rusle2 License, version 2006-Jul-24
http://www.rusle2.org


GENERAL

Rusle2 is a scientific tool used to provide estimates of long-term average 
annual soil erosion for use in conservation planning. Rusle2 relies on both
the scientific understanding and background of the user and a good understanding 
of how erosion science is specifically applied within the RUSLE framework. 
This can only be obtained by thorough training and familiarity with the RUSLE 
documentation. The Rusle2 developers will provide good-will support for use 
of the software as funding allows, but accept no responsibility for training 
users or guaranteeing the accuracy of program results.


GRANT OF LICENSE

The Rusle2 developers grant the user free use of the Rusle2 software. They 
request that the Rusle2 software be cited, including a version number, in
all materials resulting from its use.


SOFTWARE REDISTRIBUTION

The Rusle2 developers request that users not redistribute the software, but 
obtain the program from an official download site. Software not obtained
from an official Rusle2 download site will not be supported in any way by 
the Rusle2 developers.

The right to use Rusle2 DOES NOT grant the right to redistribute or modify 
the software or any of its components.


SOURCE CODE

The Rusle2 developers may at times release or publish parts of the RUSLE2 source 
code (or equations on which it is based) for use by external developers and 
scientists. This is for informational purposes only. Use of RUSLE2 source code or 
equations does not grant the user the right to claim that the results obtained 
are "RUSLE2" results. That statement may only be made for results produced by an 
official Rusle2 binary (application or library) obtained from an authorized 
download site.


DISCLAIMER

This software is distributed free of charge, and carries no implied or explicit 
warranties. Any liability through use or misuse or of the software rests solely
with the user


THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE

Rusle2 incorporates third party components.  No rights are granted to use 
these components in any way separately from the Rusle2 application.  These 
components are covered by separate licenses below. These third party licenses 
apply only to those software components, not to Rusle2 as a whole.
